# Kusto-Tutorial

Kusto Query Language or KQL is a read only request to process data and return results. KQL is run in Azure Data Explorer which has the capability to handle large amounts of structured, semi-structured (JSON-like nested types) and unstructured (free-text) data.

I use it at work and my fascination with this language has grown over the last couple of months which has motivated me to create this GitHub repository. This tutorial covers the basics of KQL synatx which can be found under Microsoft Documentation. I have consoloidated that information here for easy reference as I build my understanding of the language.

PS: This is a work in progress.
